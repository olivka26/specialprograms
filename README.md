# specialprograms

I wrote hermit.cpp when I was studying 1 grade at MSU. My teacher told me to approximate by cubic polynomials but I haven't got him. As a result, I spent a lot of time on this task.

I read some books about interpolation and wrote a program defining degree of optimal poynomial automatically.

When I showed it, my teacher was about to spurn it referring to Stanislavsky: "8-th degree polynomial cannot be approxiamted so good by cubic ones (the error was less than expected).

So I explained my solution - I used divide differences so the degree is calculated automatically.

Then he tested my code on transcendental functions but the error remains minute.

Finally, my teacher stopped it and accepted.

P.S. I'm ready to sacrifice time for exactness
